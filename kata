      "description": "Check for Concealed Buttons or Switches:Switches or buttons are two of the commonly used elements in Toca Life World PC. Finding and activating these buttons will trigger an in-game event or open a secret room. With that said, it is important to perform a thorough search for a specific room when exploring. Making exploration a regular part of your playthrough will up your chances of discovering something cool in the game."

      "description": "A Clean Pet is a Great Pet:You can choose from hundreds of pets in Toca Life World PC. Just like in real life, pets in this game mostly like to play in the mud. If this happens, all you need to do is dip your dirty pet in water. You can also get a sponge to wipe off the dirt from your loyal companion."

      "description": "Become a Gross Master Chef:Toca Life World PC also features a diverse collection of restaurants for you to explore. The best part about these restaurants is that you can create your own signature meal in the game. As interesting as that may sound, not all restaurants come with high-end menus and fresh ingredients. One example of these types of restaurants is the Pet Shop that will allow you to combine various pet foods."
